Our job is to create a program that can classify new images such as these into either one of the two categories. <br> <br>\n",

Instead, it may output 0's and 1's, where \"dog\" is represented by 0, and \"cat\" is represented by 1. The input for our algorithm, therefore, is the **data** contained within our **features**, and the output is the **targets**.
